# 🔍 Troubleshooting: PromoLanding Page Not Showing

## Issue
The route `/with/TEST123` is not showing on babystepsplanner.com

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. **Cloudflare Deployment Not Complete** (Most Likely)
Cloudflare Pages can take 5-10 minutes to deploy after pushing to GitHub.

**Check deployment status:**
1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Navigate to Workers & Pages → Your project
3. Check "Deployments" tab for status
4. Look for any build errors

### 2. **Build Failed on Cloudflare**
Sometimes the build fails due to Node version or missing dependencies.

**Check build logs:**
- In Cloudflare dashboard → Your project → Latest deployment → View build log
- Look for red errors

**Common fixes:**
- Ensure Node version matches (you have `"node": ">=20"` in package.json)
- Check if all dependencies are committed

### 3. **Local Build & Test First**
Run locally to ensure it works:

```bash
cd /Users/alexanderwood/Desktop/BabyTracker

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build locally
npm run build

# Start local server
npm start
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000/with/TEST123

### 4. **Force Rebuild on Cloudflare**
If local works but production doesn't:

1. Make a small change (add a comment)
2. Push again:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Force rebuild - add promo landing route"
git push
```

### 5. **Check Browser Console**
Visit babystepsplanner.com/with/TEST123 and:
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Check Network tab - is it returning 404?

### 6. **Verify Files Are Committed**
Ensure all files are pushed:

```bash
git status
git log --oneline -n 5  # Check recent commits
```

Make sure these files are committed:
- `src/components/PromoLanding.js`
- `src/components/PromoLanding.css`
- `src/App.js` (with the route added)

### 7. **Clear Cloudflare Cache**
Sometimes Cloudflare caches the old build:

1. Cloudflare Dashboard → Your domain
2. Caching → Configuration
3. Click "Purge Everything"

### 8. **Check _redirects File**
Cloudflare Pages uses a `_redirects` file. Check if you have one that might be interfering:

```bash
ls public/_redirects
```

If it exists, ensure it's not blocking the route.

## Quick Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if files are committed
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only

# Check Cloudflare Pages build command
cat package.json | grep build

# Test build locally
npm run build
ls -la build/  # Should see built files

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Expected Behavior
When working correctly:
1. Visit: babystepsplanner.com/with/TEST123
2. Should see: Promo landing page with "Invalid or expired promo code" (since TEST123 doesn't exist in database)
3. No 404 error

## Most Likely Solution
**Wait 5-10 minutes** for Cloudflare to complete deployment, then try again. 

If still not working after 15 minutes, check the Cloudflare dashboard for build errors.
