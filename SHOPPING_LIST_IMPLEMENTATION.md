## 🗂️ Files Created/Modified

## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. **Update Your Live Database**
You need to add the new columns to your existing `baby_items` table. Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add budget integration fields to baby_items table
ALTER TABLE baby_items 
ADD COLUMN budget_category_id UUID REFERENCES budget_categories(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
ADD COLUMN price DECIMAL(10, 2),
ADD COLUMN price_source TEXT,
ADD COLUMN starred BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN links JSONB;

-- Drop the old budget_items table (after confirming you want to lose this data)
-- DROP TABLE budget_items;
```

### 2. **Test Locally**
```bash
cd /Users/alexanderwood/Desktop/BabyTracker
npm start
```

### 3. **Deploy to Cloudflare**
Once you're happy with local testing:
```bash
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "Implement Shopping List with budget integration"
git push origin main
```

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

- ✅ Remove dependency on budget_items table

## 📱 Mobile Experience

The Shopping Mode provides an excellent mobile experience:
