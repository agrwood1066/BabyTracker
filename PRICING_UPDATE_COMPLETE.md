# 🎉 Baby Steps Paywall Implementation - Updated with Simplified Pricing

## ✅ Changes Made for Simplified Pricing

I've updated all components to use your single £6.99/month pricing:

### 1. **Pricing Structure**
- **Monthly:** £6.99/month (single price, no launch/regular distinction)
- **Annual:** £69.99/year (saves £14 vs monthly)
- Both include 14-day free trial

### 2. **Updated Components**
- ✅ `useSubscription` hook - Removed launch pricing logic
- ✅ `PaywallModal` - Shows £6.99/month and £14 annual savings
- ✅ `.env` file - Simplified to use REACT_APP_STRIPE_MONTHLY_URL
- ✅ Database functions - Updated to standard pricing
- ✅ Removed all "launch price" badges and messaging

## 📋 Your Action Items

### 1️⃣ **Update Your Stripe Payment Links in .env**

Since you mentioned you've already set up your Stripe products, make sure your `.env` file has:

```env
REACT_APP_STRIPE_MONTHLY_URL=https://buy.stripe.com/5kQ6oH7Yi8D2gJveMNeME00
REACT_APP_STRIPE_ANNUAL_URL=https://buy.stripe.com/fZu4gzdiC2eE0Kx8opeME01
```

### 2️⃣ **Run Database Migration**

1. Go to [Supabase SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lzppcmkjdgunhldgcgka/sql)

2. Run the main migration:
   - Copy all content from `/supabase/subscription_paywall_schema.sql`
   - Paste and click "Run"

3. If you get an error on the pricing function, run the fix:
   - Copy content from `/supabase/fix_pricing_function.sql`
   - Paste and click "Run"

### 3️⃣ **Test the System**

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/BabyTracker
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000/subscription-test
